# METHODS (notes)
Due to skewed distributions, median values are reported with upper and lower limits of central 90% of observations.
Unless otherwise noted, the realtionship between biomass gain (stem or area basis) and biomass quantity was modeled as an exponential negative relationship to log-DBH ($growth = e^{a+b \times \log{DBH}}$).

## Urban forest structure in Boston
Tree canopy covered `r round(sum(cover$can)/sum(cover$area),2)*100`% of the study area of which `r round(sum(cover$ed)/sum(cover$can), 2)*100`% was within 10 m of an edge, but canopy, biomass, and fragmentation degree were distributed differently between LULC types (Figure 1). Developed and High-density Residential areas covering, respectively, `r round(cover[lulc==2, sum(area)]/sum(cover$area), 2)*100`% and `r round(cover[lulc==3, sum(area)]/sum(cover$area), 2)*100`% of the total urban area contained `r round(cover[lulc==2, sum(can)]/sum(cover$can), 2)*100`% and `r round(cover[lulc==3,sum(can)]/sum(cover$can), 2)*100`% of total canopy area of which `r round(cover[lulc==2, sum(ed)]/cover[lulc==2, sum(can)], 2)*100`% and `r round(cover[lulc==3, sum(ed)]/cover[lulc==3, sum(can)], 2)*100`% was within 10 m of an edge (Table S1 -- canopy and biomass configuration summary). In contrast, while Forest areas covered only `r round(cover[lulc==1, sum(area)]/sum(cover$area), 2)*100`% of the study area they contained `r round(cover[lulc==1, sum(can)]/sum(cover$can), 2)*100`% of the total urban canopy and `r round(cover[lulc==1, sum(biom)]/sum(cover$biom), 2)*100`% of total biomass, of which only `r round(cover[lulc==1, sum(ed)]/cover[lulc==1, sum(can)], 2)*100`% was within 10 m of an edge. The extensive area of HD Residential land, containing a significant fraction of the total city biomass under highly fragmented conditions, implies a potentially large contribution of these types of canopy configurations to overall urban "forest" productivity, but which also requires specific accounting for urban- and canopy-specific influence on growth rates. In contrast, Forest-type land cover covered a small fraction of total land surface but contained a significant fraction of overall biomass and at much lower canopy fragmentation than other developed cover types. These relatively small areas of forest might as a result be expected to perform a significant proportion of total C uptake for the city, but under different growing conditions and uptake rates than in surrounding urban trees.

## Growth rates in urban context
On a stem basis, urban trees grew more quickly and showed increased growth nearer to canopy edges (Figure 2). Rural forest trees grew more slowly than urban forest trees, with median DBH `r paste(round(live[,median(DIAM_T0, na.rm=T)], digits=1), " (", round(live[,quantile(DIAM_T0, probs=c(0.05))], 1), "-", round(live[,quantile(DIAM_T0, probs=c(0.95))], 1), ")", sep="")` cm corresponding to median annual growth of `r paste(round(live[,median(growth.ann.rel, na.rm=T)], digits=1), " (", round(live[,quantile(growth.ann.rel, probs=c(0.05))], 1), "-", round(live[,quantile(growth.ann.rel, probs=c(0.95))], 1), ")", sep="")` kg/kg. The best fit model for rural stem growth rate (Table S2 -- model coefficients and p values) (residual std. error `r round(mfia$sigma, 3)`) showed a significant negative relationship with log-DBH (p<`r p.fixer(mfia$coefficients[2,4])`) and a significantly higher per-stem rate of growth in softwood species compared to hardwoods (p<`r p.fixer(mfia$coefficients[3,4])`). Successive complete DBH measurements in all rural forest trees >12 cm DBH showed a comparble significant negative exponential relationship (p<`r`) between annual hardwood biomass gain (MgC per MgC/ha) and total biomass density (MgC/ha), excluding plots with <25% hardwoods by total biomass (Figre S3 -- plot level growth). Median per-area growth rate in rural forest plots was `r 

Trees in urban forest grew faster than in rural forest, and grew more quickly within 10 m of a canopy edge than in canopy interior (20-30 m). Median DBH of edge (<10 m) and interior stems was `r round(andy[seg.Edge=="E", median(dbh.start, na.rm=T)], digits=1)` cm and `r round(andy[seg.Edge=="I", median(dbh.start, na.rm=T)], digits=1)` cm, respectively, corresponding to median annual growth of `r round(andy[seg.Edge=="E", median(biom.rel.ann, na.rm=T)], digits=3)` kg/kg and `r round(andy[seg.Edge=="I", median(biom.rel.ann, na.rm=T)], digits=3)` kg/kg. The best fit model for urban forest stem growth rate (estimating random slopes and intercepts for sample plot, year interval, and stem ID) showed a significant negative effect for log-DBH (p<`r p.fixer(p.andy[2,4])`) and a significantly lower growth rate in interior-grown stems (p<`r p.fixer(p.andy[3,4])`). Projecting these stem growth rates to the record of all stems >5 cm DBH by edge distance class in each test plot, 


The best model for stem growth in urban forest ($e^{a+b \times \log{DBH}+c[interior]}$, random slope and intercept estimated for sample plot, year interval, and stem) had coefficients of *a* = `r round(s.andy$coefficients[1,1], 3)` (SE `r round(s.andy$coefficients[1,2], 3)`), a significant effect for DBH (*b* = `r round(s.andy$coefficients[2,1], 3)` (SE `r round(s.andy$coefficients[2,2], 3)`), p<`r p.fixer(p.andy[2,4])`) and a negative correction for interior-grown trees (*c* = `r round(s.andy$coefficients[3,1], 3)` (SE `r round(s.andy$coefficients[3,2], 3)`), p<`r p.fixer(p.andy[3,4])`)


The best mixed model for street trees showed the highest median annual growth rate of `r round(street[record.good==1 & dbh.2006>5, median(npp.ann.rel, na.rm=T)], digits=3)` kg/kg corresponding to median DBH of `r round(street[record.good==1 & dbh.2006>5, median(dbh.2006, na.rm=T)], digits=1)`. The range and median stem DBH in each sample context were similar, but the street tree sample included very few conifers and a relatively large fraction of non-native taxa, primarily deciduous hardwoods including members of *Gleditsia*, *Zelkova* and *Pyrus*.
