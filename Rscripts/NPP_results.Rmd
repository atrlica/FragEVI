## Results and Discussion
### Urban forest structure in Boston
Tree canopy covered `r round(sum(cover$can)/sum(cover$area),2)*100`% of the study area of which `r round(sum(cover$ed)/sum(cover$can), 2)*100`% was within 10 m of an edge, but canopy, biomass, and fragmentation degree were distributed differently between LULC types (*Figure 1*). Developed and High-density Residential areas covering, respectively, `r round(cover[lulc==2, sum(area)]/sum(cover$area), 2)*100`% and `r round(cover[lulc==3, sum(area)]/sum(cover$area), 2)*100`% of the total urban area contained `r round(cover[lulc==2, sum(can)]/sum(cover$can), 2)*100`% and `r round(cover[lulc==3,sum(can)]/sum(cover$can), 2)*100`% of total canopy area, of which `r round(cover[lulc==2, sum(ed)]/cover[lulc==2, sum(can)], 2)*100`% and `r round(cover[lulc==3, sum(ed)]/cover[lulc==3, sum(can)], 2)*100`% was within 10 m of an edge (*Table S1 -- canopy and biomass configuration summary*). In contrast, while Forest areas covered only `r round(cover[lulc==1, sum(area)]/sum(cover$area), 2)*100`% of the study area they contained `r round(cover[lulc==1, sum(can)]/sum(cover$can), 2)*100`% of the total urban canopy and `r round(cover[lulc==1, sum(biom)]/sum(cover$biom), 2)*100`% of total biomass, of which only `r round(cover[lulc==1, sum(ed)]/cover[lulc==1, sum(can)], 2)*100`% was within 10 m of an edge. The extensive area of HD Residential land, containing a significant fraction of the total city biomass under highly fragmented conditions, implies a potentially large contribution of these types of canopy configurations to overall urban forest productivity, but which also requires specific accounting for urban- and canopy-specific influence on growth rates. In contrast, Forest-type land cover covered a small fraction of total land surface but contained a significant fraction of overall biomass and at the lower range of canopy fragmentation than other developed cover types. These relatively small areas of forest might as a result be expected to perform a significant proportion of total C uptake for the city, but under different growing conditions and C uptake rates than in surrounding urban trees.

### Tree and forest growth rates in varying urban contexts
Stem growth rate was fastest in street trees, with median annual growth rate of `r make.quantile(street[record.good==1 & dbh.2006>5, diam.rate], 2)` cm yr-1 corresponding to median DBH of `r make.quantile(street[record.good==1 & dbh.2006>5, dbh.2006], 1)` cm. The best fit mixed model for street tree stem growth (RSE `r round(mstreet$sigma, 2)`) (*Figure 2*) showed significant fixed effect decline in annual DBH increment with increasing DBH (*Table S2*). Trees in urban forest grew faster than in rural forest, and grew more quickly within 10 m of a canopy edge than in canopy interior (20-30 m). Median DBH increment of edge (<10 m) and interior stems was `r make.quantile(andy[seg.Edge=="E", dbh.incr.ann], 2)` cm yr-1 and `r make.quantile(andy[seg.Edge=="I", dbh.incr.ann], 2)` cm yr-1, corresponding to median DBH of `r make.quantile(andy[seg.Edge=="E", dbh.start], 1)` cm and `r make.quantile(andy[seg.Edge=="I", dbh.start], 1)` cm, respectively. The best fit mixed model for urban forest stem growth (RSE `r round(mandy$sigma, 2)`) showed a significant fixed effect decline in DBH increment with DBH with significantly lower slope and intercept in interior-grown stems (*Table S2*). Rural forest trees grew more slowly than urban forest or street trees, with median growth rate of `r make.quantile(live[lag!=0 & STATUS==1, diam.rate], 2)` cm yr-1 corresponding to median DBH `r make.quantile(live[lag!=0 & STATUS==1,DIAM_T0], 1)` cm. The best fit model for rural stem growth rate (RSE `r round(mfia$sigma, 2)`) showed a significant fixed effect increase in DBH increment with stem DBH. The range and median of stem DBH in each growth context were similar, except for a lack of trees 5-12 cm DBH range in the rural forest sample. However the street tree sample included very few conifers and a relatively large fraction of non-local taxa, including members of *Ginkgo*, *Gleditsia*, *Pyrus*, *Tilia* and *Zelkova* (*Table S4*). Variability in stem growth rate across the range of sizes was greater for street trees than urban or rural forest-grown trees, but all three contexts showed a significant fixed effect of stem size on growth increment.

Projecting modeled stem growth rates for stems >5 cm DBH by edge distance class, median predicted areal-basis biomass growth rate in urban forest plots was `r make.quantile(andy.plot.edge$pred.med, 3)` Mg-gain Mg-biomass-1 in edge plots (>10 m) and `r make.quantile(andy.plot.int$pred.med, 3)` Mg-gain Mg-biomass-1 in interior plots (20-30 m). These growth rates corresponded to plot biomass density of `r make.quantile(andy.plot.edge$Init.biomass.kg, 0)` and `r make.quantile(andy.plot.int$Init.biomass.kg, 0)` MgC ha-1 in edge and interior plots, respectively. Both edge and interior plots showed a significant negative effect of biomass density on areal-basis biomass growth rate, with a significantly lower intercept for interior plots (*Table S2*). In rural forest plots, areal-basis biomass growth rate in all stems >12.7 cm DBH (MgC-gain MgC-biomass-1) was `r make.quantile(live.plot[HWfrac>0.25,biom.delt.ann.rel.HW], 3)` with plot biomass density of `r make.quantile(live.plot[HWfrac>0.25,biom0.MgC.ha], 0)` MgC ha-1. Rural forest plots showed a significant negative fixed effects trend in log-biomass growth rate with increasing plot biomass density (*Table S2*). The design of the street tree survey did not allow for modeled stem growth rates to be projected to areal-basis biomass growth, necessitating the simulation of individual stem assemblages across the study area.

### Estimates of net annual biomass C uptake
Estimated net annual biomass C uptake (GgC/yr) in the Hybrid Urban model was `r npp.tot[7,3]` GgC, with the largest annual biomass gains in the Forest and HD Residential land use types (*Table 1*). By comparison, applying rural forest growth factors to per-ha-canopy biomass density showed lower biomass gain in all land use categories, with a total of `r fia.tot[7,4]`) GgC/yr, with a greater relative fraction of total biomass gain accruing to forest stands. This reduced estimate, particuarly in non-forested cover types, is partly the result of lower per-stem and per-area biomass gain in rural forest context than seen in urban edge forest or individual street trees. The Hybrid estimate apportioned biomass gains similarly to the distribution of total biomass across the study area, with most biomass gains occuring in the more common moderate-density pixels dominated by the open-canopy High-Density Residential type. The rural forest model, in contrast, apportioned relatively more total biomass gain into the less common Forest land cover type. In the Hybrid Urban model, median per-pixel annual biomass gain was `r pix.sum[7,5]` MgC/ha compared with `r pix.sum[7,3]` MgC/ha in the Rural Forest model, with the largest comparative increases in Forest, HD Residential and LD Residential areas.

### Effect of biomass density area basis 
The model results also illustrate the sensitivity of estimating biomass productivity via its relationship to biomass density due to the ambiguity of the areal basis to be used in determning biomass density in heterogeneous scattered urban tree stands. An example of typical discontinous urban canopy in the study area shows that at moderate levels of both canopy and impervious cover, estimates of biomass density in a given area can vary from 25 MgC/ha-ground to 76 MgC/ha-canopy to 404 MgC/ha-pervious (*Figure 3*). In the same area, common remotely sensed measures of vegetation cover and function such as NDVI may indicate a relatively barren condition though the area contains appreciable canopy. Application of ground-basis biomass densitiy calculations resulted in somewhat higher overall C uptake estimates compared to canopy-basis calculations even under identical underlying growth rate models due to generally lower shift in calculated biomass density corresponding to generally higher predicted growth rates (Table 1). Rather than reflecting underlying ecosystem processes better captured by modeling tree growth based on urban conditions and measurements, these up-adjusted results instead likely an artifact of the neagatively shifted distribution of pixel biomass density on a ground-area basis in the discontinuous tree stands in the study area.

## Conclusions
Estimating forest productivity in urban areas has often required reliance on incomplete or infrequent field surveys of living trees, reliance on estimation models developed in other bioclimatic regions or non-urban systems, or application of coarse-resolution remote sensing measurements that obscure heterogeneity in urban vegetation cover that carry meaningful ecosystem functional consequences, such as the prevalence of canopy edges. Difficulties in accurately estimating forest productivity in urban context may also be due to two general types of ambiguity: The first ambiguity is that the fundamental relationship between tree size and productivity measured in rural forest stands may not be reflected in urban-grown trees that experience different canopy environments, nutrient inputs, and a host of other anthropogenic effects not present in rural forests. To address this ambituity, this work has attempted to apply size-to-growth-rate relationships that were measured in local urban-grown trees that may more accurately represent forest ecosystem processes at work in the local urban context. 

Density-based approaches are often used to inventory C sequestration and annual uptake in rural forests, based on the predictable relationship between stand age (density) and C uptake within a given region and species assemblage (e.g. FIA COLE). The second ambiguity in estimating urban forest productivity is in the application of biomass density-to-productivity relationships developed from measurements of less intensively managed and impacted stands of continuous canopy trees at predictable stages of succession to discontinous and heterogenous collections of urban trees. In this work, biomass density in a functional sense was estimated on the basis of high-resolution biomass estimates measured against overlapping measures of canopy coverage for each pixel. The constraint of canopy coverage in determining biomass density, while imperfect, arguably provides a better appraisal of the distribution of tree size (and by proxy growth rate) in a given area and a better basis for comparison to density-to-productivity estimates developed through measurements in continuous canopy forests. The extent of available pervious cover, we argue, is a less useful correction for functional biomass density because the size and stem density of urban trees is less constrained by the availabilty of open soil compared to the availability of open space for canopy. The presence in the Boston study area of implausibly high estimates of biomass density on a pervious basis (up to 5000 MgC/ha-pervious) is likely an artifact of the capacity of relatively large trees to grow in nearly completely paved conditions so long as adequate open space above the impervious surfaces is available for canopy exposure. The distribution of estimates of biomass density on a canopy basis shows more realistic density values, and may well more accurately indicate the relative sizes of trees present in different land cover types. 

Without accounting for canopy coverage and spacing, the commonplace urban example of stands of discontinuous canopy with relatively mature large trees appears similar in density to younger lower-biomass stands of smaller trees spread evenly over the same area. Such stands in continuous forest context tend to grow relatively more quickly than more mature stands, and in the case of the Boston study area the relatively high frequency of discontinous stands with low- to moderate biomass density on a per-ground-area basis raised the overall estimate of total biomass gain. The example of the ground-basis estimates of productivity above shows that uncritically mapping a growth-to-density relationship applicable to continuous forests on onto discontinous urban tree stands may lead to misapplying growth factors in a way that could occasionally produce estimates of productivity that appear "corrected" to the urban context, but are only an artifact of the incindental cancellation of errors. 

Thus even if accurate and reasonably spatially resolved inventories of forest carbon by area are available for a city, the potential differences in urban per-stem growth rate and the inability to adequately quantify "density" in an ecosystem functional sense may still produce difficulties in producing accurate estimates of C uptake. 

Therefore you should be careful and do it the way we did it. Canopy is the better metric because...

As growth and C uptake in forest stands is very often predicted on the basis of biomass density (also a proxy for stand age), these ambiguities in the call for caution in selecting an appropriate method for ascertiaining biomass density, particularly in scattered open-canopy urban stands.
